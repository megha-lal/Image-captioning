# Image Captioning

Automatically generate captions for a set of images. This could be useful for accessibility concerns such as in case of blind people.

he Flicker 8k dataset is a collection of 8,000 images, each with a resolution of 800x600 pixels, that were originally sourced from the photo-sharing website Flickr. The images are divided into 5,000 training images and 2,000 validation images. This dataset is often used for benchmarking and evaluating computer vision algorithms, particularly for tasks such as image captioning and image retrieval.
